# Changelog

All notable changes to NadirClaw will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Configurable embedding backends for the centroid classifier** — `NADIRCLAW_EMBEDDING_BACKEND` (default `sentence-transformers`; also `ollama` via `/api/embed`), `NADIRCLAW_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `NADIRCLAW_EMBEDDING_API_BASE`, and `NADIRCLAW_CENTROID_DIR`. Custom centroid directories require a `centroid_metadata.json` (schema-versioned, with `prototypes_hash` for traceability) so users never silently mismatch a self-built centroid against a different encoder. `nadirclaw build-centroids` gains `--backend`, `--model`, `--api-base`, `--output-dir` flags. Original work by @clawSean (#50).
- **Optional prompt-injection guard** — `nadirclaw/prompt_guard.py`. Heuristic detection of 7 patterns (instruction override, role reassignment, prompt extraction, JSON role confusion, delimiter injection, encoded payloads, DAN/jailbreak). `NADIRCLAW_PROMPT_GUARD`: `log` (default) / `warn` / `block`. Scans only user/tool messages — system/assistant treated as trusted. Original work by @pradumna-gautam (#55, supersedes #31).
- **Optional PII redactor** — `nadirclaw/pii_redactor.py`. Detects email, US phone, SSN, and Luhn-validated credit-card numbers. `NADIRCLAW_PII_REDACTION`: `none` (default) / `log_only` / `redact`. Non-streaming responses only. Original work by @pradumna-gautam (#55).

### Security
- **Production hardening baseline** — recommended for anyone exposing `nadirclaw serve` beyond localhost. Original work by @pradumna-gautam (#30).
  - **CORS**: explicit allowlist via `NADIRCLAW_CORS_ORIGINS`; localhost regex default; never wildcard + credentials.
  - **Auth**: constant-time token comparison via `hmac.compare_digest` to defeat timing-side-channel guessing.
  - **Security headers** on every response: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Cache-Control: no-store` on `/v1/*`, opt-in HSTS via `NADIRCLAW_HSTS=true`.
  - **Bounds validation** on `ChatCompletionRequest`: caps on messages (500), `max_tokens` (100K), `temperature` (0–2), `top_p` (0–1), `n` (1–8) — closes a cost-amplification surface.
  - **Sanitized validation errors** — Pydantic internals no longer leak to clients; full details still server-side logged.
  - **Async logging** — SQLite writes moved off the event loop into a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, with `done_callback` exception logging and `shutdown(wait=True)` on SIGTERM so queued entries drain instead of dropping.
  - **Prompt truncation** — 500-char default in SQLite request logs (configurable via `NADIRCLAW_LOG_PROMPT_TRUNCATE`); API-key shaped tokens (`sk-…`, `AIza…`, `ghp_…`, `gho_…`, `xox[bpars]-…`) redacted from logged system prompts.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages` endpoint** — Anthropic-native clients (Claude Code) now route through NadirClaw. The proxy classifies, rewrites the `model` field, forwards to `api.anthropic.com`, and pipes SSE streaming through byte-for-byte (#51).
- **Seamless Claude Code integration** — `nadirclaw claude onboard` / `shim` / `uninstall`. Onboarding detects models, maps them into tiers, persists `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` into `~/.claude/settings.json`, and installs a launchd / systemd auto-start unit (#51).
- **Live model detection** — onboarding queries Anthropic's `/v1/models` using the stored token (Bearer for subscription tokens, `x-api-key` for API keys) instead of a hardcoded list; `--interactive` lets you pick a model per tier (#51).
- **Pluggable complexity classifier** — `NADIRCLAW_COMPLEXITY_ANALYZER=binary` (default, ~10ms centroid) or `distilbert` (3-class fine-tuned DistilBERT predicting simple/mid/complex natively). The DistilBERT artifact downloads from the Hugging Face Hub on first use with a graceful fallback to binary (#51, #52).
- **Pro upsell surfaces** — `nadirclaw savings` / `serve` / `report` and the README now surface Nadir Pro at high-intent moments with attribution-tagged URLs; new `demo/cost_vs_opus.py` zero-API-key demo (#53).
- **Enriched `/v1/models`** — responses now include Anthropic-style `type` / `display_name` / `description` / `created_at` alongside the OpenAI-style fields.

### Fixed
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is written as the bare host (Claude Code appends `/v1/messages` itself; a `/v1` suffix produced a broken `/v1/v1/messages` path) (#51).
- Updated the stale Claude model fallback list from the 4.5/4.1 generation to the 4.6 family (#51).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **`nadirclaw update-models` command** — writes refreshable model metadata to `~/.nadirclaw/models.json`, optionally merging a published registry JSON via `--source-url` or `NADIRCLAW_MODEL_REGISTRY_URL`.
- **Local model metadata overrides** — the router now merges `~/.nadirclaw/models.json` and user-managed `~/.nadirclaw/models.local.json` into the runtime model registry.
- **DeepSeek V4 explicit aliases** — added `deepseek-v4`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, and `deepseek-v4-pro` while preserving the existing `deepseek` alias for `deepseek/deepseek-chat`.
- **Model pool weighted load balancing** — pool tier configuration with weighted round-robin across multiple models in the same tier (#36).
- **Selective context compression module** — opt-in compression for tool-heavy contexts (#40).
- **Complex coding detection and enhanced reasoning markers** — improved tier classification for coding-heavy prompts and Chinese reasoning markers (#38).
- **Upgrade-only session cache for agent frameworks** — caches routing decisions per session to avoid repeated downgrades on multi-turn agent flows (#27).
- **Agent role detection for AI coding assistants** — recognizes Claude Code / Cursor-style system prompts and routes accordingly (#37/#45).
- **Fallback reasons logging** — failed fallback attempts now record ordered per-model `fallback_reasons` with compact error types and sanitized messages (#47).
- **Provider health-aware fallback routing** — optional `NADIRCLAW_PROVIDER_HEALTH=true` mode tracks in-process model health and tries healthy fallback candidates before cooling-down ones; debug snapshot via `/internal/provider_health` (#48).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Thinking/reasoning token passthrough** — transparently forwards thinking parameters and extracts reasoning content from all provider paths:
  - **Request forwarding**: `reasoning_effort` (OpenAI o-series), `thinking` (Anthropic extended thinking), `thinking_config` (Gemini), and `response_format` are now passed through to LiteLLM, Anthropic OAuth, and Gemini native paths.
  - **Response extraction**: `reasoning_content` (DeepSeek), `thinking` blocks (Anthropic), and `thought` parts (Gemini) are captured from LLM responses and included in `choices[].message`.
  - **Usage reporting**: `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` surfaced when providers report thinking token counts.
  - Works in both streaming (real SSE and fake/cached SSE) and non-streaming response formats.
- 15 new tests covering thinking parameter forwarding, response extraction, JSON serialization safety, and streaming passthrough.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Context Optimize** — new preprocessing stage that compacts bloated context before LLM dispatch, reducing input token cost by 30-70%. Two modes:
  - **`safe`** — five deterministic, lossless transforms: JSON minification, whitespace normalization, system prompt dedup, tool schema dedup, chat history trimming.
  - **`aggressive`** — all safe transforms + diff-preserving semantic deduplication. Uses sentence embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to detect near-duplicate messages (cosine similarity >= 0.85), then extracts only the unique diff phrases using `difflib.SequenceMatcher`. Refinements survive dedup — "return values, not indices" is preserved even when 90% similar to an earlier message.
- **Accurate token counting with tiktoken** — uses `cl100k_base` BPE tokenizer instead of `len//4` heuristic. Falls back gracefully if tiktoken is not installed.
- **Shared sentence encoder** — lazy-loaded `SentenceTransformer` singleton in `nadirclaw/encoder.py` for aggressive mode. No import cost when using safe mode or off.
- **`nadirclaw optimize` command** — dry-run CLI tool to test context compaction on files or stdin. Supports `--mode safe|aggressive` and `--format text|json`.
- **`--optimize` flag on `nadirclaw serve`** — set optimization mode at startup (`off`, `safe`, `aggressive`).
- **Per-request `optimize` override** — pass `"optimize": "safe"` in the request body to override the server default for individual requests.
- **Optimization metrics** — `tokens_saved`, `original_tokens`, `optimized_tokens`, and `optimizations_applied` logged per request in JSONL, SQLite, and Prometheus. Web dashboard shows aggregate savings.
- New env vars: `NADIRCLAW_OPTIMIZE` (default: `off`), `NADIRCLAW_OPTIMIZE_MAX_TURNS` (default: `40`).
- 60 automated tests covering safe transforms, aggressive semantic dedup, accuracy preservation, edge cases, and roundtrip integrity.

### Changed
- SQLite schema: added columns `optimization_mode`, `original_tokens`, `optimized_tokens`, `tokens_saved`, `optimizations_applied` (auto-migrated on startup).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **`nadirclaw test` command** — probes each configured model tier with a short live request and reports latency, response, and pass/fail. Exits with code 1 on failure so it works in CI. Supports `--simple-model`, `--complex-model`, and `--timeout` overrides.
- **`classify --format json`** — new `--format text|json` flag on `nadirclaw classify`. JSON output includes `tier`, `is_complex`, `confidence`, `score`, `model`, and `prompt`. Composable with `jq`.
- **Multi-word prompt support for `classify`** — `nadirclaw classify What is 2+2?` now works without quoting. Previously only the first word was captured.

### Changed
- **`nadirclaw savings` now prefers SQLite** — mirrors `nadirclaw report`: reads from `requests.db` when available, falls back to `requests.jsonl`. Previously only JSONL was read, giving empty or stale results for users without a JSONL file.
- **`nadirclaw dashboard` now prefers SQLite** — same fix as savings; dashboard no longer shows empty data when only `requests.db` exists.
- **`SessionCache` LRU eviction is now O(1)** — replaced `List[str]` + `list.remove()` (O(n) per cache hit) with `collections.OrderedDict` + `move_to_end()` / `popitem(last=False)`, both O(1). Affects `routing.py`.
- **`ModelRateLimiter.get_status` is now thread-safe** — all reads of `_limits`, `_hits`, and `_default_rpm` are now taken inside the lock, eliminating a potential data race under concurrent requests.

### Fixed
- **`auth status` indentation** — the "no credentials" help block was over-indented (12 spaces) and the provider hint strings were misaligned. Fixed to consistent 4-space indentation.
- **Removed redundant `load_dotenv()` in `serve`** — `settings.py` already loads `~/.nadirclaw/.env` at import time; the extra bare `load_dotenv()` call in the `serve` command was a no-op that could cause confusion when debugging env resolution.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- OpenClaw onboard: register nadirclaw provider without overriding the agent's primary model

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Configurable fallback chains** — when a model fails (429, 5xx, timeout), cascade through a configurable list of fallback models. Set `NADIRCLAW_FALLBACK_CHAIN` to customize the order.
- **Real-time spend tracking and budget alerts** — every request's cost is tracked by model, daily, and monthly. Set `NADIRCLAW_DAILY_BUDGET` and `NADIRCLAW_MONTHLY_BUDGET` for alerts at configurable thresholds. New `nadirclaw budget` CLI command and `/v1/budget` API endpoint.
- **Prompt caching** — LRU cache for identical prompts. Configurable TTL (`NADIRCLAW_CACHE_TTL`, default 5min) and max size (`NADIRCLAW_CACHE_MAX_SIZE`, default 1000). New `nadirclaw cache` CLI command and `/v1/cache` API endpoint. Toggle with `NADIRCLAW_CACHE_ENABLED`.
- **Web dashboard** — browser-based dashboard at `/dashboard` with auto-refresh. Shows routing distribution, per-model stats, cost tracking, budget status, and recent requests. Dark theme, zero dependencies.
- **Docker support** — official Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml. `docker compose up` gives you NadirClaw + Ollama for a fully local zero-cost setup.

### Changed
- Fallback logic upgraded from simple tier-swap to full chain cascade
- Request logs now include per-request cost and daily spend
- Budget state persists across restarts via `budget_state.json`

## [0.3.0] - 2025-02-14

### Added
- OAuth login for all major providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Google Antigravity
- Interactive Anthropic login — choose between setup token or API key
- Gemini OAuth PKCE flow with browser-based authorization

- Credential file writes use atomic temp-file-and-rename pattern
- Token refresh failures return `None` instead of silently returning stale tokens
- OAuth callback server binds to `localhost` (was `127.0.0.1`)

### Fixed
- Version mismatch between `__init__.py`, `cli.py`, `server.py`, and `pyproject.toml`
- README references to `nadirclaw auth gemini-cli` (now `nadirclaw auth gemini`)
- OAuth callback server getting stuck (now uses `serve_forever()`)
